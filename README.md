# WikipediaReader
This single page Wikipedia reader uses Angular, the Wikipedia API, and ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).

Up and running here: http://codepen.io/BenjaminDowns/full/dGBWKb/

This wikipedia reader lets the user search for and read articles from Wikepedia. The view defaults to a "List View" that shows all articles whose title matches the query. A toggle button switches to the "Reader View," which shows the top hit for the query. An empty query redirects to a random Wikipedia article.
